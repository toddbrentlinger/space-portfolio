- Use random 2D field to place star locations 
- OR could create function that could 
produce the same random seeding of 3d coordinates for stars given coordinates 
away from center.
    - Given args coordinates, provide star positions within sphere of args radius around coordinates.
    Used to render only the stars around camera position as it moves through the animation.
    - Create random positions for all stars around origin within sphere of given radius. 
    Use these positions to determine the star positions every unit outside the sphere. Once initial
    random star positions around origin are created, could just calculate the rest using 
    an algorithm.
    - Use perlin noise to create pseudo-random stars within 1m3 cube. Can then place all those stars given 
    coordinates within the cube within a 1m3 around that origin, assuming the initial cube repeats.
    Just need to keep cubic-coords for n-number of stars within 1x1x1 unit cube.
