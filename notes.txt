Patrick Stewart Star Trek TNG Monologue:

Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its 
five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and new 
civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before!

Web Development: the final frontier. This is the portfolio of the developer Todd Brentlinger. 
His lifelong mission: to explore strange new frameworks; to seek out new employment and new projects;
to boldly go where no developer has gone before!

- Use random 2D field to place star locations 
- OR could create function that could 
produce the same random seeding of 3d coordinates for stars given coordinates 
away from center.
    - Given args coordinates, provide star positions within sphere of args radius around coordinates.
    Used to render only the stars around camera position as it moves through the animation.
    - Create random positions for all stars around origin within sphere of given radius. 
    Use these positions to determine the star positions every unit outside the sphere. Once initial
    random star positions around origin are created, could just calculate the rest using 
    an algorithm.
    - Use perlin noise to create pseudo-random stars within 1m3 cube. Can then place all those stars given 
    coordinates within the cube within a 1m3 around that origin, assuming the initial cube repeats.
    Just need to keep cubic-coords for n-number of stars within 1x1x1 unit cube.
